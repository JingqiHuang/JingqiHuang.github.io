									<h4>Enable WiFi-like coverage in millimeter-wave (mmWave) network</h4>
									<p>The emerging mmWave networking technology promises to unleash a new wave of multi-Gbps wireless applications. However, mmWave is known to be highly directional and bear limited coverage, so maintaining stable link connection and achieving WiFi-like coverage is challenging and not well solved. Thus we developed several systems to enable robust connection under link dynamic and enable room-level omnidirectional coverage in mmWave network.</p>
									<div class="features">
										<article>
											<!--div class="inner"-->
												<h5>Enable omnidirectional coverage using array of phased array (APA) architecture</h5>
												<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/apa.png" alt="" /></a>
												<div class="inner">
												<p>We propose X-Array, which jointly selects the arrays and beams, and applies a dynamic co-phasing mechanism to ensure different arrays’ signals enhance each other. X-Array also incorporates a link recovery mechanism to identify alternative arrays/beams that can efficiently recover the link from outage. We have implemented X-Array on a commodity 802.11ad APA radio. Our experiments demonstrate that X-Array can approach omni-directional coverage and maintain high performance in spite of link dynamics.</p></div>
												<p></p>


												<h5>Leverage robotic relay to realize room-level seamless coverage</h5>
												<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/romil.png" alt="" /></a>
												<div class="inner">
												<p>  Our design enables a robot relay automatically constructs the geometry/reflectivity of the environment using measured RSS only, then navigates itself along an optimal moving trajectory, and ensures continuous connectivity for the client despite environment/human dynamics. Our field trials demonstrate that our design can achieve nearly full coverage in dynamic environments, even with constrained speed and mobility region.</p>
												</div>
												<p></p>
												<h5>Model-driven beam prediction to achieve robust mmWave connection under mobility and blockage</h5>
												<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/ada.png" alt="" /></a>
												<div class="inner">
												<p>Our design leverages the observation that mmWave spatial channel profiles (SCP) of nearby locations are highly-correlated, so we can reconstruct the SCP as the Tx/Rx moves with possible blockages, using a reverse-engineering approach without explicit channel scanning. We also design and incorporate greedy approximation algorithms to resolve the high computational complexity issue conventionally involved with reverse-engineering. In this way, we can predict new optimal beams and realign links for mobile/blocked users with minimal overhead. </p>

											<h4>Maximizing the channel ultilization in Multi-User Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) system</h4>
												<p>MU-MIMO is the hallmark of IEEE 802.11 ac and ax, which guarantees the multi-fold throughput gain by supporting multiple concurrent data transmissions from multiple users. But the channel can be significantly under-utilizatized due to the diverse size of the frames which is widely-distributed from dozens of bytes to maximum transmission unit (MTU) usually of 1500 bytes. Then all the shorter frames have to wait till the longest frame completes its transmission. Thus we were exploring the possibility of utilizing the channel by adding more data streams in the idle channel.</p>

												<h5>Maximizing channel utilization for MU-MIMO systems using Knapsack padding</h5>
												<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/padding.jpg" alt="" /></a>
												<div class="inner">
												<p>We propose a novel model-driven frame padding design to maximize MU-MIMO channel utilization. We first formally formulate the frame padding problem as a multi-stream knapsack model, and then design a stream decoupling mechanism to handle the unique and complicated inter-stream interference underlying the model, so as to derive the optimal padding schedule efficiently. We evaluate our design using trace-driven emulation. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate remarkable throughput gain (up to 42%) compared with the state-of-the-art.</p>
